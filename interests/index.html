      <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am a very outgoing person and enjoy many activities ranging from
          hanging out with friends and playing sports. To watching movies and
          playing video games. I am not the biggest social media fan, so if I am
          browsing the web in my free time I am usually on <a href= "https://www.reddit.com" title= "The reddit homepage" target="_blank"> Reddit.</a>

          I grew up with four brothers so I have been playing all different
          kinds of sports all my life. I am a very competitive person and enjoy
          playing games and sports that competitive in nature. I was a twelve
          sport athlete in high school and played club water polo for the University
          of Iowa. Below are a few of my favorite sports.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Water Polo</li>
          <li>Golf</li>
          <li>Football</li>
          <li>Swimming</li>
          <li>Basketball</li>

        <p>
          I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. I
          find them to be one of the greatest past times. They combine multiple
          art forms and can be played by anyone and everyone. If you say you
          don't enjoy video games, I would say you just haven't found the right
          game. Similar to my love for competitive sports, competitive games are
          my favorite. Here are a few of my favorites.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Overwatch</li>
          <li>StarCraft</li>
          <li>Halo</li>
          <li>Destiny</li>
          <li>Hearthstone</li>
